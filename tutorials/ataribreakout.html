  <h1>How To Play Atari Breakout (JS And HTML)</h1>

  <section id="introduction"><p>Yes. You came here from the <a href="games/ataribreakout">gamepage</a> so that you can learn to play this game.</p>

  <p>First of all, you can only play this game on a computer or laptop. So, it's a big "F" for mobile users.</p>

  <p>How To Play:</p>

  <p>1. To move the paddle (the blue thingy that the bottom), you can use the the left and right arrow key. You also can use your mouse. Move it left or/and right and it will detect your movement</p>

  <p>2. The ball will bounce everywhere (dUh). It will hit a block. Each block the ball hits, you get a point. If the ball doesn't hit the paddle when it bounces back from the block, you lose a life and the next round will start immediately.</p>

  <p>3. You have a slight advantage to win after losing a life</p>

  <p>4. When you touch the ground, the next round starts. The paddle and the ball will start from the middle and starts bouncing to the right.</p>

  <p>The ball will slip through the empty hole of the bricks...</p>

  <p>5. When you win it will show a message box like this: "YOU WIN! Play Again? (press OK to play again)"</p>

  <p>6. Press "OK" to play again</p>

  <p>*Step 5 & 6 also applies if "Game Over"</p>

  <p>After this tutorial, I'm pretty sure you can play this game already.</p>
